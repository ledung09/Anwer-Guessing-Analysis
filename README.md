# Analysis of Multiple Guessing Answer Strategies for Last 10 Questions of University Entrance Exam
In this analysis, we will evaluate the effectiveness of four different multiple guessing answer strategies for the last 10 questions of a university entrance exam. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we will consider all 24 possible exam paper codes, taking into account variations in question order and answer keys.\
The four strategies to be examined are:
1. All Same Keys
2. Slide Keys
3. Diagonal Keys
4. Random Keys

### Strategy 1: All Same Keys
The first strategy involves selecting the same answer choice for all 10 questions. This can be either selecting all "A"s, all "B"s, all "C"s, or all "D"s. This strategy assumes that there might be a pattern in the answer key where the same choice is repeated multiple times.

### Strategy 2: Slide Keys
The second strategy, known as Slide Keys, follows a pattern where the answer choices slide from one option to the next. For example, if the first five questions are answered with "A", the next five questions will be answered with "B". This pattern continues until all 10 questions are answered.

### Strategy 3: Diagonal Keys
The third strategy, known as Diagonal Keys, assumes a diagonal pattern in the answer key. Starting with the first question, the answer choices will be selected as "A", "B", "C", "D" sequentially. If there are more than four questions, the pattern continues from the beginning. For instance, if there are 10 questions, the pattern would be "A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B".

### Strategy 4: Random Keys
The fourth strategy is the Random Keys approach, where the answer choices are selected randomly without following any particular pattern or sequence. This strategy assumes that each question is independent and does not rely on any predetermined pattern in the answer key.

## Analysis Methodology
To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, we will consider the following factors:
- Accuracy: The percentage of correct answers obtained using each strategy.
- Probability of Random Guessing: The likelihood of selecting the correct answer by pure chance, assuming a multiple-choice question with four options.
We will simulate each strategy multiple times to obtain statistically significant results and compare them based on accuracy and the probability of random guessing.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the four multiple guessing answer strategies (All Same Keys, Slide Keys, Diagonal Keys, and Random Keys) for the last 10 questions of a university entrance exam, we can determine their effectiveness in achieving higher accuracy compared to random guessing. The results of this analysis will provide insights into the efficacy of each strategy and help individuals make informed decisions when approaching multiple-choice exams.
